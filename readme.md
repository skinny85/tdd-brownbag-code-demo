The code demo for my brownbag on Test-Driven Development at Amazon. The
purpose of the exercise is to implement a simple queue (of type FIFO) -
doing just the enqueue an dequeue methods is all that is required -
using TDD, of course.

The branch 'solution' contains my example code, with commits after every step
of the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.
